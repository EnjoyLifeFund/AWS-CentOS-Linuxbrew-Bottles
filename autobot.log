==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall go`
==> Caveats
A valid GOPATH is required to use the `go get` command.
If $GOPATH is not specified, $HOME/go will be used by default:
  https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH

You may wish to add the GOROOT-based install location to your PATH:
  export PATH=$PATH:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/go/libexec/bin
